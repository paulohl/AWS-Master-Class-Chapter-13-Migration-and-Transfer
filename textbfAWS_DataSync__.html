<div><b>AWS DataSync</b></div><div>AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies
and accelerates moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage
systems and AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. It is designed to transfer data
securely and efficiently over the internet or AWS Direct Connect links,
enabling organizations to migrate data, perform data backups, and
synchronize data across different storage environments.</div><div>Key Features of AWS DataSync:</div><ul><li><b>High-Speed Data Transfer</b> : AWS DataSync utilizes a
purpose-built transfer protocol optimized for high-speed data
transfer, enabling organizations to move data at speeds up to 10 times
faster than traditional data transfer methods.</li><li><b>Simple Setup and Management</b> : The service offers a
user-friendly console and command-line interface (CLI) for configuring
and managing data transfer tasks. Users can easily set up transfer
tasks, monitor progress, and troubleshoot any issues using AWS
Management Console.</li><li><b>Automatic Encryption and Data Validation</b> : AWS DataSync
automatically encrypts data in transit using SSL/TLS protocols and
provides data integrity validation during transfer to ensure that data
arrives securely and intact at the destination.</li><li><b>Support for Multiple Storage Systems</b> : AWS DataSync supports a
wide range of storage systems, including Network Attached Storage
(NAS), Storage Area Networks (SAN), and file servers, allowing
organizations to migrate data from various sources to AWS storage
services seamlessly.</li><li><b>Incremental Data Transfer</b> : The service performs incremental
data transfers, ensuring that only the changes made to files since the
last transfer are synchronized, reducing overall transfer time and
bandwidth usage.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that demonstrate the practical
applications of AWS DataSync:</div><div>Scenario 1: Data Migration to Amazon S3</div><div>A media production company needs to migrate large video files stored on
its on-premises NAS device to Amazon S3 for archival and disaster
recovery purposes. The company leverages AWS DataSync to transfer
terabytes of video data to Amazon S3 buckets securely and efficiently.
With DataSync, the company sets up transfer tasks, specifies the source
and destination locations, and configures data transfer options such as
encryption and validation settings. AWS DataSync transfers the video
files to Amazon S3, where they can be accessed and managed easily using
AWS services like Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies and Amazon S3 Glacier for
long-term storage.</div><div>Scenario 2: Data Synchronization Across Multiple Locations</div><div>A multinational retail chain operates multiple regional data centers
that store inventory and sales data for its stores worldwide. The
company wants to ensure that inventory data remains synchronized across
all data centers in near real-time to optimize inventory management and
fulfillment operations. Using AWS DataSync, the company sets up
bidirectional data synchronization tasks between its regional data
centers and Amazon EFS file systems in AWS regions closest to each data
center. DataSync continuously synchronizes inventory data between
on-premises data centers and AWS, ensuring that all locations have
access to the latest inventory information, improving operational
efficiency, and reducing the risk of stockouts.</div>
