<div><b>AWS Application Discovery Service</b></div><div>The AWS Application Discovery Service is a tool designed to help
businesses plan their migration to the AWS cloud by providing insights
into their existing on-premises infrastructure and applications. By
collecting information about servers, storage, network dependencies, and
application performance, the service enables organizations to make
informed decisions about migration strategies, resource optimization,
and cost estimation.</div><div>Overview of AWS Application Discovery Service:</div><div>The AWS Application Discovery Service offers the following key features:</div><ul><li><b>Agentless Data Collection</b> : The service utilizes agentless
data collection techniques to gather information about on-premises
infrastructure and applications. This approach minimizes the impact on
existing systems and simplifies the data collection process.</li><li><b>Comprehensive Discovery</b> : AWS Application Discovery Service
collects detailed information about servers, including hardware
specifications, operating systems, installed software, network
configurations, and interdependencies between applications.</li><li><b>Application Mapping</b> : The service maps the relationships and
dependencies between applications, databases, and infrastructure
components, providing a comprehensive view of the IT environment.</li><li><b>Performance Metrics</b> : AWS Application Discovery Service
captures performance metrics and utilization data for servers and
applications, helping organizations identify potential performance
bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.</li><li><b>Integration with AWS Services</b> : The service seamlessly
integrates with other AWS migration and management tools, such as AWS
Migration Hub and AWS Server Migration Service, to streamline the
migration process and facilitate resource provisioning.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that demonstrate the practical
applications of AWS Application Discovery Service:</div><div>Scenario 1: Migration Planning for Data Center Consolidation</div><div>A multinational corporation is planning to consolidate its data centers
to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. The IT team uses AWS
Application Discovery Service to perform a comprehensive assessment of
the existing data center infrastructure and applications. The service
collects detailed information about servers, network topology, and
application dependencies across multiple data centers. Using the
insights provided by the discovery service, the IT team identifies
redundant servers, underutilized resources, and opportunities for
workload consolidation. Based on this analysis, the organization
develops a migration plan to migrate workloads to AWS, optimize resource
utilization, and achieve cost savings.</div><div>Scenario 2: Application Portfolio Assessment for Cloud Migration</div><div>A software development company is considering migrating its application
portfolio to the AWS cloud to leverage cloud-native services and improve
scalability. The company employs AWS Application Discovery Service to
assess its application landscape and identify migration candidates. The
service gathers information about application dependencies, performance
metrics, and resource utilization patterns across development, testing,
and production environments. Using the insights provided by the
discovery service, the company evaluates the suitability of each
application for cloud migration based on factors such as complexity,
compatibility with AWS services, and business value. The assessment
helps the company prioritize migration efforts, allocate resources
effectively, and minimize disruption to business operations during the
migration process.</div>
