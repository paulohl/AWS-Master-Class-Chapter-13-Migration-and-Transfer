<div><b>AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)</b></div><div>The AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is a fully managed service
designed to simplify and accelerate the migration of virtualized
applications to the AWS cloud infrastructure. MGN enables organizations
to migrate their on-premises applications to AWS with minimal downtime,
risk, and complexity, thereby facilitating seamless transition to the
cloud.</div><div>Overview of AWS Application Migration Service:</div><div>AWS Application Migration Service offers a range of features and
capabilities to support the migration process:</div><ul><li><b>Agentless Migration</b> : MGN enables agentless migration,
eliminating the need to install and manage migration agents on
individual servers. This simplifies the migration process and
minimizes disruption to ongoing operations.</li><li><b>Continuous Replication</b> : MGN facilitates continuous
replication of on-premises servers to AWS, ensuring that data is kept
in sync between the source and target environments. This enables
organizations to perform live cutovers with minimal data loss and
downtime.</li><li><b>Automated Machine Conversion</b> : MGN automatically converts
source machines into AWS instances during the migration process,
streamlining the deployment of migrated applications in the AWS cloud.</li><li><b>Integrated Testing Environment</b> : MGN provides an integrated
testing environment where organizations can validate the functionality
and performance of migrated applications before the final cutover.
This helps mitigate risks and ensures a smooth transition to the
cloud.</li><li><b>Bandwidth Optimization</b> : MGN optimizes bandwidth utilization
during data replication, allowing organizations to minimize network
impact and reduce migration-related costs.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that illustrate the practical
applications of AWS Application Migration Service:</div><div>Scenario 1: Lift-and-Shift Migration of Web Application</div><div>Imagine a retail company running a web application on-premises to manage
its online store. The company decided to migrate its web application to
AWS to leverage the scalability and reliability of cloud infrastructure.
Using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), the company initiates an
agentless migration of its web servers to AWS. MGN continuously
replicates data from on-premises servers to AWS, ensuring data
consistency and minimizing downtime. The company utilizes the integrated
testing environment provided by MGN to validate the performance and
functionality of the migrated web application. Upon successful testing,
the company performs a live cutover, redirecting traffic to the
AWS-hosted web application.</div><div>Scenario 2: Migration of Legacy CRM System</div><div>Consider a financial institution with a legacy customer relationship
management (CRM) system hosted on-premises. The institution decides to
modernize its CRM system by migrating it to the AWS cloud. Using AWS
Application Migration Service (MGN), the institution initiates an
automated migration of its CRM servers to AWS. MGN continuously
replicates data from on-premises servers to AWS, ensuring data integrity
throughout the migration process. The institution leverages MGN’s
bandwidth optimization features to minimize network impact during data
replication. After successful replication, the institution conducts
comprehensive testing of the migrated CRM system in the integrated
testing environment provided by MGN. Following successful testing, the
institution performs a seamless cutover to the AWS-hosted CRM system,
enabling enhanced scalability and agility.</div>
