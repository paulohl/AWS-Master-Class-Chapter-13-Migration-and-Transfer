<div><b>Visual Aid Recommendation:</b></div><div>A recommended visual aid for illustrating AWS Transfer Family could be a
diagram depicting the architecture and workflow of file transfer
processes using the Transfer Family services. The diagram could
highlight key components such as SFTP/FTPS/FTP endpoints, Amazon S3
buckets, Amazon EFS file systems, and integration with monitoring and
logging services like AWS CloudWatch and Amazon CloudTrail.
Additionally, graphical representations of file transfer activities and
data flow between components could enhance readers’ understanding of the
Transfer Family’s capabilities and use cases.</div>
