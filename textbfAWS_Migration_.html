<div><b>AWS Migration Hub</b></div><div>AWS Migration Hub is a centralized service that enables organizations to
plan and track the migration of their applications and workloads to the
AWS cloud. It provides a unified view of migration progress, resource
utilization, and application readiness across multiple AWS and partner
solutions, simplifying the migration process and reducing complexity.</div><div>Key Features of AWS Migration Hub:</div><ul><li><b>Unified Dashboard</b> : AWS Migration Hub offers a centralized
dashboard where organizations can view and track the progress of their
migration projects in real time. The dashboard provides visibility
into the status of individual migration tasks, dependencies between
resources, and overall migration readiness.</li><li><b>Integration with Migration Tools</b> : Migration Hub integrates
seamlessly with a variety of AWS and partner migration tools, such as
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS Database Migration Service
(DMS), and CloudEndure Migration. This allows organizations to use
their preferred migration tools while still benefiting from
centralized tracking and management capabilities.</li><li><b>Application Discovery and Assessment</b> : Migration Hub provides
tools for discovering and assessing on-premises applications and
infrastructure, helping organizations understand their dependencies
and requirements before initiating the migration process. This enables
more accurate planning and resource allocation during the migration
journey.</li><li><b>Migration Status and Reporting</b> : With Migration Hub,
organizations can generate detailed reports on migration status,
including progress, errors, and dependencies. These reports help
stakeholders monitor the overall health of migration projects,
identify potential issues, and make informed decisions to ensure a
smooth migration process.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that highlight the benefits of AWS
Migration Hub:</div><div>Scenario 1: Enterprise Application Migration</div><div>A large enterprise is planning to migrate its on-premises applications
to the AWS cloud to achieve greater scalability, agility, and cost
efficiency. Using AWS Migration Hub, the organization conducts a
comprehensive discovery and assessment of its application portfolio,
identifying dependencies, performance metrics, and resource utilization
patterns. Based on the assessment findings, the organization develops a
migration plan and utilizes Migration Hub to track the progress of each
application migration, ensuring minimal disruption to business
operations and maximizing the success of the migration initiative.</div><div>Scenario 2: Data Center Consolidation</div><div>A global organization with multiple data centers across regions is
undergoing a data center consolidation initiative to streamline
operations and reduce infrastructure costs. Leveraging AWS Migration
Hub, the organization gains visibility into the migration progress of
servers, databases, and applications across different data centers.
Migration Hub enables centralized tracking of migration tasks,
dependencies, and resource utilization, allowing the organization to
optimize resource allocation, minimize downtime, and ensure compliance
with regulatory requirements throughout the consolidation process.</div>
