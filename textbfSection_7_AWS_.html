that enable organizations to securely transfer files to and from Amazon
S3 and Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) storage systems. It offers three

and AWS Transfer for FTP, providing flexible options for file transfer
protocols while maintaining high levels of security and compliance.</div><div>Key Features of AWS Transfer Family:</div><ul><li><b>Managed File Transfer</b> : AWS Transfer Family eliminates the

infrastructure. It provides fully managed file transfer services with
automatic scaling, high availability, and built-in monitoring and
logging capabilities.</li><li><b>Support for Standard Protocols</b> : The Transfer Family supports
industry-standard file transfer protocols, including SFTP (SSH File
Transfer Protocol), FTPS (FTP over SSL), and FTP (File Transfer
Protocol). This allows organizations to leverage their existing
workflows and tools while migrating to the AWS cloud.</li><li><b>Integration with AWS Services</b> : AWS Transfer Family seamlessly
integrates with Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS, enabling organizations to
store transferred files securely and cost-effectively in scalable
storage solutions. It also integrates with AWS CloudWatch for
monitoring and Amazon CloudTrail for logging and auditing file
transfer activities.</li><li><b>Security and Compliance</b> : The Transfer Family prioritizes
security and compliance by offering features such as encryption at

data during file transfers.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that illustrate the use cases of AWS
Transfer Family:</div><div>Scenario 1: Secure Data Exchange with External Partners</div><div>A financial services company needs to securely exchange sensitive
financial documents with external partners, such as banks, auditors, and
regulatory agencies. Using AWS Transfer Family’s SFTP service, the
company sets up secure file transfer endpoints hosted on AWS. External
partners can securely upload and download files to and from the
company’s Amazon S3 buckets using their preferred SFTP clients, ensuring
data confidentiality and integrity throughout the exchange process.</div><div>Scenario 2: Automated Data Backup to Amazon S3</div><div>A media production company requires a reliable and scalable solution for
automated data backup and archival of large media files generated during
video production projects. Leveraging AWS Transfer Family’s FTPS
service, the company sets up automated file transfer workflows to
periodically back up media files from on-premises storage systems to
Amazon S3 buckets. With built-in encryption and data integrity features,
AWS Transfer Family ensures the secure and efficient transfer of large
volumes of media files to the AWS cloud for long-term storage and
archival purposes.</div>
