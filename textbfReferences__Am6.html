assessment tool offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps
organizations analyze their on-premises infrastructure and workloads to
determine the feasibility, cost, and performance implications of
migrating to the AWS cloud. Migration Evaluator utilizes advanced
analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide data-driven
insights and recommendations for optimizing migration strategies and
maximizing return on investment (ROI).</div><div>Key Features of Migration Evaluator:</div><ul><li><b>Infrastructure Discovery and Analysis</b> : Migration Evaluator
automatically discovers and inventories on-premises servers, virtual
machines, and applications, capturing detailed information about
resource utilization, performance metrics, and interdependencies. It
provides organizations with a comprehensive view of their existing
infrastructure and workloads, enabling informed decision-making during
the migration planning process.</li><li><b>Workload Right-Sizing</b> : Migration Evaluator analyzes resource
utilization patterns and performance characteristics of on-premises
workloads to identify opportunities for right-sizing and optimization.
It helps organizations optimize resource allocation and minimize
over-provisioning by recommending appropriate instance types and
configurations in the AWS cloud based on workload requirements and
usage patterns.</li><li><b>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis</b> : Migration Evaluator
performs detailed TCO analysis, comparing the cost of running
workloads on-premises versus in the AWS cloud. It factors in various
cost components such as hardware depreciation, software licensing,
maintenance, and operational expenses, allowing organizations to
accurately assess the financial implications of migrating to AWS and
make data-driven decisions to optimize cost and maximize savings.</li><li><b>Performance and Dependency Mapping</b> : Migration Evaluator
analyzes workload performance metrics and identifies interdependencies
between applications and infrastructure components. It helps
organizations understand the impact of migration on application
performance, latency, and network traffic patterns, enabling them to
mitigate risks and ensure a smooth transition to the AWS cloud.</li></ul><div>User Scenarios:</div><div>Let’s explore two user scenarios that illustrate the use cases of
Migration Evaluator:</div><div>Scenario 1: Cloud Migration Planning for a Large Enterprise</div><div>A large enterprise with a diverse portfolio of on-premises applications
and infrastructure is planning to migrate its workloads to the AWS cloud
to achieve greater scalability, agility, and cost efficiency. Using
Migration Evaluator, the enterprise conducts a comprehensive assessment
of its existing IT environment, including server hardware, virtual
machines, storage systems, and application stacks. Migration Evaluator
analyzes resource utilization, performance metrics, and cost data to
generate actionable insights and recommendations for workload migration,
right-sizing, and optimization. Based on the analysis, the enterprise
develops a phased migration plan, prioritizing critical workloads,
optimizing resource utilization, and estimating cost savings potential.</div><div>Scenario 2: Data Center Consolidation and Cloud Migration Strategy</div><div>A global organization with multiple data centers spread across different
regions is exploring options to consolidate its data center footprint
and migrate workloads to the AWS cloud to streamline operations and
reduce infrastructure costs. Migration Evaluator helps the organization
assess the feasibility and impact of data center consolidation
initiatives by analyzing resource utilization, performance bottlenecks,
and dependency mappings across data center environments. It identifies
redundant workloads, underutilized resources, and opportunities for
workload consolidation and optimization. With insights from Migration
Evaluator, the organization formulates a data center consolidation and
cloud migration strategy that prioritizes workload rationalization,
minimizes disruption, and maximizes cost savings.</div>
