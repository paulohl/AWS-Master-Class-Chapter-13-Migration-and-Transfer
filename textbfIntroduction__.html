<div><b>Introduction</b></div><div>Welcome to Chapter 12 of ”AWS Cloud Computing Master Class” where we
delve into the intricate world of Migration &amp; Transfer services offered
by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In this chapter, we will explore a diverse
range of tools and services designed to facilitate seamless migration,
transfer, and modernization of workloads, applications, and data to the
AWS cloud infrastructure.</div><div>The migration journey to the cloud represents a critical phase for
organizations seeking to leverage the scalability, reliability, and
agility offered by cloud computing. Whether it involves migrating
existing applications, databases, or storage systems, or modernizing
legacy mainframe applications, AWS provides a comprehensive suite of
services to simplify and expedite the migration process.</div><div>Our exploration begins with the <b>AWS Application Migration
Service (MGN)</b> , a fully managed service designed to help organizations
migrate their virtualized applications to AWS with minimal downtime and
risk. We’ll examine how MGN simplifies the migration process by
automating the bulk of the workload migration tasks, including
replication, testing, and cutover, thereby reducing the complexity and
duration of migration projects.</div><div>Next, we’ll dive into the <b>AWS Application Discovery Service</b> , a
tool that enables organizations to perform comprehensive discovery of
their on-premises applications, servers, and dependencies. We’ll explore
how AWS Application Discovery Service provides valuable insights into
application interdependencies, resource utilization, and performance
metrics, empowering organizations to make informed migration decisions
and streamline the migration planning process.</div><div>Our journey continues with the <b>AWS Database Migration Service
(DMS)</b> , a fully managed service that facilitates the migration of
databases to AWS with minimal downtime and data loss. We’ll uncover how
DMS supports heterogeneous database migrations, including Oracle, SQL
Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, while ensuring data integrity,
consistency, and security throughout the migration process.</div><div>We’ll then turn our attention to <b>AWS DataSync</b> , a data transfer
service designed to simplify, automate, and accelerate data transfer
between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services. We’ll
examine how DataSync enables organizations to securely transfer large
volumes of data to AWS, optimize network bandwidth utilization, and
ensure data integrity and consistency across distributed environments.</div><div>In addition to application and data migration services, we’ll explore<b>AWS Mainframe Modernization</b> , a comprehensive set of tools and
services designed to help organizations modernize their legacy mainframe
applications and workloads on AWS. We’ll discuss the strategies, best
practices, and migration patterns for transitioning mainframe
applications to modern, cloud-native architectures, leveraging AWS
technologies and partner solutions.</div><div>Our journey through the migration landscape will also encompass the<b>AWS Migration Hub</b> , a centralized hub for tracking and managing
the progress of application and data migrations across multiple AWS and
partner solutions. We’ll uncover how Migration Hub provides
organizations with visibility into migration status, resource
utilization, and cost tracking, enabling them to effectively manage
migration projects at scale.</div><div>Furthermore, we’ll explore the <b>AWS Transfer Family</b> , a set of
fully managed services that enable organizations to transfer files,
data, and workloads to AWS securely and seamlessly. We’ll examine the
capabilities of AWS Transfer Family services, including AWS Transfer for
SFTP, FTPS, and FTP, and discuss how organizations can leverage these
services to modernize their file transfer workflows and improve
operational efficiency.</div><div>Finally, we’ll introduce the <b>Migration Evaluator</b> (formerly TSO
Logic), a tool that helps organizations assess their on-premises
workloads and infrastructure to determine the feasibility and
cost-effectiveness of migrating to AWS. We’ll explore how Migration
Evaluator provides organizations with insights into workload
utilization, performance, and cost, enabling them to make informed
migration decisions and optimize resource allocation in the cloud.</div><div>Throughout this chapter, we will provide practical insights, best
practices, and real-world examples to guide organizations through the
migration and transfer journey, empowering them to unlock the full
potential of the AWS cloud infrastructure.</div><div>Join us as we embark on a transformative journey through the world of
Migration &amp; Transfer services offered by AWS, and discover how these
services can accelerate innovation, drive business agility, and fuel
digital transformation initiatives.</div><div>Welcome to Chapter 12 of ”AWS Cloud Computing Master Class”: Migration
